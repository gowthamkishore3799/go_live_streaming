# Building a streaming application with hls

This project focuses on how a streaming application can be built. It's not an industry-level project, but rather something I created to deepen my understanding of live streaming and to explore issues related to it, like the ones seen in high-profile events (e.g., Netflix streaming issues during the Jake Paul vs. Tyson fight).

## How it works: 

To understand how it works, I will be publishing a Medium article on it soon.
